MonsterPop---Android
====================
MonsterPop is a tetris-like game where two players compete against each other via blueetoth (hotseat also available). 
Four adjacent blocks of the same colour break, but if more than four are connected, the other player gets a dead block or even a dead line. See the screenshots bellow.
